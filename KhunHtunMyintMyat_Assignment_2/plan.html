<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>We are a small family-run local business, operating in Kirwan since 2012, hoping to improve our
    business by getting on the Internet.<br>
    <LI><B>Target Audience: </B>We have customers of all ages, however, we would like to attract young families and young people,
      possibly around the age of 17 - 35, to our bakery.
    <LI><B>Success Evaluation: </B> Our bakery is located at 123 Prize Lane in Kirwan, Queensland.
      We specialise in traditional Australian baked goods. We are currently in the process of getting some
      images created, so please just choose some ones for placeholders at the moment so we can see
      what it will look like..<br>  From what we saw from other websites, we think
            we probably need 7 - 8 pages for our site </p>
             <h3><a href="homepage.html">Home page</a></h3>
  <p><b>Home page</b>  should be very appealing and drive interest in our bakery. We also want to
    show some sample images of the products to be displayed to attract the site visitors'
    attention. </p>
    <LI>We want our customers to be able to sign up for weekly specials! We think there
      should be a page for our weekly specials to further attract customers.
    <LI> The home page should highlight these two customers comments:<br>
      'Petite Treats has the best cheesecake I've ever had. Always fresh, and melts in the
mouth. Would recommend highly!'<br>'I'm addicted to the Danish pastries and always drop in here on my way to work.'
